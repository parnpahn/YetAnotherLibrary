YetAnotherLibrary
=================

Yet another library for .NET.

I create this project simply becasue there are utility classes duplicated in many projects and I feel it's better to put them together in one place for maintainability.

Feel free to contribute and fork the repository. I'll try to review it with my spare time.

You can get [Yalib NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Yalib/) or [full source code at GitHub](https://github.com/huanlin/YetAnotherLibrary).

**NOTE**: If you have been added Yalib v1.0.\* to your projects via NuGet, please remove it and add it again. This is because I changed NuGet package version from 1.0.\* to 0.0.\*. (Sorry!)
